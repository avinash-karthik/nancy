When deployed on azure webapps by trying out mysql, the app did not run properly -- need to check that.
Also, till now added only google authentication. Need to add facebook and twitter authetications too. For all of these, need to create a new app for the actual website hosted on azure. So, in total two apps will be created for each - one for the localhost and one for the website hosted on azure. -- need to do this.
Also, while signingup, need to add a captcha to prevent robots from signing up automatically. -- need to check that.
After this, need to write down the model for website based on the er diagram made in the design document.
Later, need to create documentdb on azure and connect it with the webapp.
After this, start coding the note editing part which requires significant time.
